      "Geneva - The World Health Organisation chief on Wednesday said a deadly plague epidemic \u001b[0m\u001b[31mappeared\u001b[0m\u001b[32m to have been brought under control in Madagascar, but warned the next outbreak would likely be stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, insisting that \"the issue is serious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An outbreak of both bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread person to person, has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April.\n",
      "On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Tedros voiced alarm that \"plague in Madagascar behaved in a very, very different way this year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns.\n",
      "The authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "He praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely.\n",
      "\n",
      "This along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that \"when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw,\" Tedros said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That means that Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond,\" he warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a dangerous combination,\" Tedros said.\n",

      "It’s a good example of \u001b[0m\u001b[31mhow badly Trump does his job \u001b[0m\u001b[32mmore than a year and a half into his administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.\n",
      "That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo.\n",
      "\n",
      "That wasn’t entirely a Trump mistake.\n",
      "His decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality-TV star’s weakness as a presidential candidate.\n",
      "The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal.\n",
      "In some ways, that’s successful coalition-building, and what he’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, it’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it’s another to turn the whole process over to them.\n",
      "We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.\n",
      "We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him, and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump’s biases: The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump’s cut-of-his-jib test by looking the part.\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting.\n",
      "The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start.\n",
      "After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay.\n",
      "Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations.\n",
      "Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble.\n",
      "It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh’s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more.\n",
      "Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn’t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.\n",

      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate.\n",
      "It’s still not clear that Kavanaugh’s nomination is doomed, but it’s certainly in severe trouble.\n",
      "Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.\n",
      "But there’s an art to minimizing damage.\n",
      "And Trump hasn’t learned it yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "For one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.\n",
      "Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh.\n",
      "If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn’t Trump’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Trump’s behavior has been as erratic as ever.\n",
      "First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward.\n",
      "He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview.\n",
      "The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n",
      "The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can’t shoot straight and that he’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative.\n",
      "And, for that matter, they’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal.\n",
      "Trump’s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts.\n",
      "As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.\n",
      "Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately.\n",
      "It's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like, which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting, would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors.\n",

      "In the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.\n",
      "Perhaps.\n",
      "There are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges, and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers.\n",
      "And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway.\n",

      "The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.\n",

      "A source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\n",
      "\n",
      "The source added that the Justice Department is working on a \"compressed timeline\" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner.\n",

      "During it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the “powerful Jews” were his enemies, and that Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,” as well as other incendiary remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him.\n",
      "Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women’s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light.\n",
      "Their reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week.\n",

      "What is the Nation of Islam?\n",
      "The Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D.\n",
      "Fard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933.\n",
      "It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.\n",
      "Encouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n",
      "But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is Louis Farrakhan?\n",
      "Born Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.\n",
      "After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.\n",
      "It was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on “the white man” as “the white devil”).\n",
      "But in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\n",
      "That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.\n",
      "(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.\n",
      "The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.\n",
      "Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\n",
      "Mr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.\n",
      "Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington.\n",

      "\n",
      "On March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet “my absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.” A day later, she said that she was “committed to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,” but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour’s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said.\n",
      "The essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\n",
      "Asked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan’s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” Mr. Curtis said.\n",

      "Coincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.\n",
      "The News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama’s candidacy.\n",

      "Today is no different — he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Representative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an “outstanding human being,” and later said he was not bothered by the leader’s position on “The Jewish Question.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite Israel's repeated warnings, Barack Obama's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security.\n",
      "In 2009, Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities, who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president.\n",
      "In 2011, Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS’s re-emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria.\n",
      "The radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the “rescue” of both countries from the Sunni terrorists, turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process.\n",
      "Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\n",
      "This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria’s Mediterranean coast.\n",
      "This road makes Iran’s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and to equip Iran’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad.\n",
      "This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.\n",
      "“Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this,” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article.\n",
      "However, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran’s Shiite Crescent expansion.\n",
      "“Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,” said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n",
      "“The Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,” Tabler added.\n",
      "“It’s a new monster.”\n",
      "Furthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces.\n",
      "And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.\n",
      "Despite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah’s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran.\n",
      "While Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection.\n",
      "Just recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles.\n",
      "Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.\n",
      "However, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran’s larger ambitions.\n",
      "In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy.\n",
      "“Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.\n",
      "As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own.”\n",
      "At least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran’s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond.\n",
      "President Trump’s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration’s milquetoast approach to Iran.\n",
      "As the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq.\n",
      "National Security Adviser H.R.\n",
      "McMaster said that the “so called liberation of areas by Assad’s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.” He claimed that the Trump administration’s “objectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,” without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mWhether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen.\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",

      "In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”\n",

      "MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said….\n",
      "Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.\n",
      "This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.\n",
      "Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.\n",
      "MGM, though, said it was “confident” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor.\n",
      "On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company’s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “wasn’t inaccurate when I provided it.” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log.\n",
      "Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m.\n",
      "The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock “in close proximity to” 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued.\n",
      "Clear, right?\n",
      "Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock’s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?\n",
      "Las Vegas police say they didn’t get to the floor until after the shooting was over.\n",
      "But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot.\n",
      "The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught….\n",
      "… on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and “immediately responded.” MGM said that “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.\n",
      "These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.” The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, “I agree with the statement.” These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories.\n",

      "These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.” The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, “I agree with the statement.” \u001b[0m\u001b[31mThese discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories.\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",

      "\n",
      "Originally published the Jerusalem Post.\n",
      "On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\n",
      "Trump’s move was not operational.\n",
      "It was directional.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\n",
      "For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.\n",
      "\n",
      "By merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\n",
      "Before Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.\n",
      "By placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "After accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\n",
      "Only then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "By empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "After putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.\n",
      "Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\n",
      "Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",
      "Trump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\n",
      "He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker’s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.\n",
      "If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\n",
      "And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\n",
      "The problem here is not obvious.\n",
      "Clearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.\n",
      "An improved deal won’t destroy Iran’s centrifuges.\n",
      "\n",
      "It won’t take away Iran’s enriched uranium.\n",
      "It won’t destroy Iran’s nuclear installations.\n",
      "And it won’t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "So long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\n",
      "Distressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\n",
      "If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\n",
      "It would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.\n",
      "It would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\n",
      "It is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.\n",
      "If they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.\n",

      "\n",
      "Last Friday, President Trump made the following announcement:\n",
      "I have decided not to block release of the CIA’s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.”\n",
      "Okay, he didn’t really put it like that.\n",
      "But that’s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:\n",
      "Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” (Italics added.)\n",
      "The operative words, of course, are: “Subject to the receipt of further information….”\n",
      "What is going on here?\n",
      "Negotiations.\n",
      "The art of the deal.\n",
      "The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.\n",
      "It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.\n",
      "Under long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return.\n",
      "That’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.\n",
      "Trump wants something in return.\n",
      "We don’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.\n",
      "Time to buy old US gold coins\n",
      "What Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: “Give me what I want and I’ll give you want you want.\n",
      "Otherwise, I will let all your cherished long-secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people.”\n",
      "Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made.\n",
      "The CIA will cave.\n",
      "It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.\n",
      "Trump is in the driver’s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret.\n",
      "And once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs.\n",
      "All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.\n",
      "Think about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s.\n",
      "The CIA’s ground?\n",
      "“National security” of course, the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon.\n",
      "National security?\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Whatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term, no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government.\n",
      "The CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret “methods” of intelligence gathering.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mReally?\n",
      "What, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones\u001b[0m\u001b[32m?\n",
      "What is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA’s request for continued secrecy.\n",
      "That should be big news.\n",
      "It’s essentially an admission of guilt, given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that “national security” would be threatened by the release of the CIA’s long-secret JFK-assassination-related records.\n",
      "You see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination.\n",
      "In their minds, the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president.\n",
      "Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.\n",
      "Let’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.\n",
      "Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said.\n",
      "He said he was being framed.\n",
      "Yet, from the very beginning, the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime.\n",
      "Instead, they have steadfastly stuck with the official story, one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame-up: That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others, both of which lead to nothing but dead ends, contradictions, and anomalies.\n",
      "Now, let’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed.\n",
      "In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.\n",
      "As part of the frame-up, the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald, its intelligence agent, as a purported communist.\n",
      "That would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist, which, not coincidentally, was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas.\n",
      "In cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.\n",
      "It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.\n",
      "They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.\n",
      "The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.\n",
      "What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.\n",
      "It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.\n",
      "But there was another big operation to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides before the assassination.\n",
      "It had to do with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.\n",
      "Something dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early post-assassination period.\n",
      "Today, Oswald’s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.\n",
      "The CIA’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.\n",
      "As I wrote in my October 11 article, “Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place.\n",
      "On the one hand, it knows that those records will further implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination.\n",
      "On the other hand, it knows that by seeking continued secrecy, it’s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, it is choosing the latter course, especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of “national security.”\n",
      "Do the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?\n",
      "Of course not.\n",
      "And they don’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.\n",
      "The CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.\n",
      "But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.\n",
      "Those long-secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, the same types of regime-change operation that took place in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Cuba in 1960-1963, Congo in 1961, and Chile in 1973, all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.\n",
      "In 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.\n",
      "Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.\n",
      "Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.\n",
      "If it did, it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover-up by continuing to keep some of the CIA’s decades-old JFK’s related assassination records secret from the American people.\n",

      "\n",
      "The plague that’s airborne and has killed at least 124 people in Madagascar is now blamed on “dancing with corpses.” This is the time of year when the dead are wrapped in sheets and paraded through the streets while others dance around the bodies.\n",
      "The local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease.\n",
      "Since it’s airborne, anyone coming close to the corpse of a person who has died of the black death could themselves, catch the infection.\n",
      "Health officials suspect it’s no coincidence that the outbreak coincides with the time of year when families customarily exhume the remains of dead relatives, wrap them in a sheet, and dance with them through the streets in a sacred ritual, AFP reports.\n",
      "“If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for [the ritual], the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body,” said Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff.\n",
      "Some locals believe the whole plague is some kind of a government conspiracy, and say they have no intention of forgoing the ritual known as “famadihana.” They say they will continue to dance with the dead and intend to honor their ancestors.\n",

      "On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.\n",

      "The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “national security” would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.\n",
      "So, why the April deadline?\n",
      "Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?\n",
      "Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.\n",
      "If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.\n",
      "Let’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.\n",
      "To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.\n",
      "If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.\n",
      "If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.\n",
      "Let’s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with “national security.” They have everything to do with covering up the CIA’s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an...

      "The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\n",
      "In the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.\n",
      "Contrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963.\n",
      "That’s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.\n",
      "Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.\n",
      "As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.\n",
      "On the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA’s guilt in the assassination.\n",
      "On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.\n",
      "What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?\n",
      "We don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.\n",
      "Here’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.\n",
      "That’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation.\n",
      "In my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.\n",
      "Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.\n",

      "Not surprisingly, the mainstream media isn’t even questioning that ludicrous notion.\n",
      "For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret.\n",
      "During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years.\n",
      "There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.\n",
      "Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago.\n",
      "The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “national security” would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.\n",
      "So, why the April deadline?\n",
      "Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?\n",
      "Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.\n",
      "If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.\n",
      "Let’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.\n",
      "To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.\n",
      "If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.\n",
      "If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.\n",
      "Let’s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with “national security.” They have everything to do with covering up the CIA’s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an...

      "that constituted a grave threat to “national security,” i.e., befriending the Russians (i.e., the Soviets) and Cubans and entering into peaceful coexistence with the communist world.\n",
      "In other words, unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, who had absolutely no motive to kill President Kennedy, the national security establishment did have motive, a powerful motive, the same motive that motivated the CIA and Pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time, such as Mohamad Mossadegh, Jacobo Arbenz, Patrice Lumumba (who Kennedy admired), Fidel Castro, and Salvador Allende.\n",
      "For a more detailed analysis of motive, read FFF’s ebook JFK’s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne, who served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.\n",
      "Immediately upon the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald, the official account was that this was just a lone nut, former U.S. Marine communist who decided, for no apparent reason, to assassinate Kennedy.\n",
      "One big problem is the official story, however, requires a suspension of logic and common sense.\n",
      "For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged.\n",
      "For anyone who has a critical, analytical, independent mindset, the official story is filled with holes.\n",
      "For example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?\n",
      "Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists?\n",
      "Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists?\n",

      "After Oswald supposedly tried to defect to the Soviet Union and promised U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the Soviet Union, which was America’s sworn Cold War enemy (and former World War II partner and ally), U.S. officials permitted him to return home with a Red wife, without even one grand-jury summons or even an iota of harassment.\n",
      "Think about Martin Luther King, John Walker Lindh, Edward Snowden, the U.S. Communist Party, or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.\n",
      "Think about how the U.S. national-security establishment treats what it suspects are communists or traitors.\n",

      "Soon after the Warren Commission was established, Warren called a super-secret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into Warren’s possession.\n",
      "That information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence.\n",

      "But to avoid detection, they needed a patsy, which is the term that Oswald used after his arrest.\n",
      "They needed to frame someone for the crime.\n",
      "And what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist?\n",
      "Part of the scheme, obviously, would be to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides.\n",
      "That’s why he was sent to New Orleans, where, contradictorily, he would work for a right-wing business owner, work with a right-wing former FBI agent, and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba.\n",
      "It was also why he was sent to Mexico City, where he would be ordered to visit the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission, maybe to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro.\n",

      "More than 500 injured.\n",
      "And yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks.\n",
      "It wasn’t always like this.\n",
      "In the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day.\n",
      "Then, once a day.\n",
      "Then, once every few days.\n",

      "They released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong.\n",
      "They took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion.\n",
      "By Oct. 13 — the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public — something had changed.\n",
      "The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative.\n",
      "Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions.\n",
      "Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman’s room.\n",
      "His platform to share that information?\n",
      "“The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which aired last week.\n",
      "He hasn’t made himself available to the media since.\n",
      "“It doesn’t matter,” FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks.\n",
      "“It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.” Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office.\n",
      "At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation.\n",
      "Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department’s director of communications, that the sheriff “will not be conducting interviews.” “As he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing” she said in an email Thursday.\n",
      "“Another media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.” When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks.\n",
      "The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation.\n",
      "“Investigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock’s life for the last few years — and they’re still not done,” Alston said.\n",
      "“We still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.” She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, “but they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation … that has filled so many news stories the past month.” Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman’s motive remains a mystery.\n",
      "More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay — where the gunman was staying — has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman’s hotel room and homes.\n",
      "Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a “do not disturb” sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it.\n",
      "Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.\n",

      "The bubonic plague outbreak that is taking Madagascar to its knees will more than likely last another six months.\n",
      "But the worst news is that the epidemic could explode anytime unleashing the sickness on the globe.\n",
      "At least 128 people have been killed and more than 1,300 infected by the deadlier pneumonic strain of the medieval disease.\n",
      "But the oncoming rainy season could see the number of those infected explode exponentially.\n",
      "The rainy season poses a threat to the containment of the plague because outbreaks of this magnitude often seem to be seasonal.\n",
      "The Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase.\n",
      "Its website said that “outbreaks of plague tend to be seasonal and occur mainly during the rainy season.” The African island’s wet season officially began today and will last until the end of April, meaning the downward trend the plague had seen over the past few days, will likely turn upward again.\n",
      "Because the disease can be spread easily through a cough or sneeze, experts are fearful.\n",
      "It would take just one infected traveler who made it to Africa’s mainland or even nearby British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles to spread the disease globally.\n",
      "The Seychelles is currently putting anyone traveling from Madagascar into quarantine on arrival as a precaution.\n",
      "The outbreak has been fueled by performing the ancient practice of Famadihana.\n",
      "Famadihana is the “dancing with the dead” ritual which sees locals dig up deceased relatives and dance with them before they are reburied.\n",
      "Just contact with a corpse who’s death was because they contracted the plague could sicken a person.\n",
      "The country’s health chief Willy Randriamarotia said: “If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for a Famadihana, the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body.” The tradition has been banned since the outbreak began, but it is feared ceremonies have taken place regardless as \u001b[0m\u001b[31mlocal continue to balk that their rituals have contributed to the outbreak\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\n",
      "This latest warning that the rainy season could worsen the outbreak comes on the heels of the reports that British aid workers said the epidemic will get worse before it gets better.\n",
      "Olivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger said: “The epidemic is ahead of us, we have not yet reached the peak.”\n",

      "Whatever else might be said about the assassination of President Kennedy, one thing is for sure: The cover-up of this particular U.S. regime-change operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed.\n",
      "This shouldn’t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up.\n",
      "As far back as 1953, the CIA published an assassination manual that the CIA succeeded in keeping secret from the American people for more than 40 years.\n",
      "It came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request.\n",
      "That was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963.\n",
      "Today, Americans can read the CIA’s assassination manual online.\n",
      "Titled “Study of Assassination,” the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people.\n",
      "Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:\n",
      "Firearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively….\n",
      "Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion.\n",
      "The propaganda value of this system may be very high.\n",
      "Time to buy old US gold coins\n",
      "The manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected.\n",
      "Note the following excerpt:\n",
      "For secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique.\n",
      "When successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.\n",
      "It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual.\n",
      "That’s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination.\n",
      "We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone.\n",

      "The CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime-change operation in Guatemala, one that was designed to violently remove the nation’s democratically elected socialist president, Jacobo Arbenz, from office and replace him with an unelected, right-wing, pro-U.S. military general.\n",
      "As part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated.\n",
      "While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.\n",
      "There is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.\n",
      "So, why were they targeted for assassination?\n",
      "Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later.\n",
      "That’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.\n",
      "Although Arbenz was able to escape the country, the CIA’s regime-change operation was a total success, with Arbenz being replaced by the pro-U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala.\n",
      "The Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious.\n",
      "The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.\n",
      "Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal.\n",
      "The CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.\n",
      "The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.\n",
      "At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\n",
      "This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\n",
      "Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.\n",
      "But he also went a step further.\n",
      "He said that he was being framed for the crime.\n",
      "The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?\n",
      "Wouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?\n",
      "That’s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.\n",
      "If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.\n",
      "Who would those confederates be?\n",
      "There could be only one answer: communists.\n",
      "Soviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.\n",
      "How would we know this?\n",
      "That’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.\n",

      "Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.\n",
      "Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year.\n",
      "So, President Kennedy has been assassinated.\n",
      "Oswald is immediately arrested.\n",
      "He has confederates firing from the front, who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists, especially since Oswald has supposedly just recently visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City.\n",
      "What does all that mean?\n",
      "An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.\n",
      "That means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the United States is going to sit idly by when the Reds have just assassinated America’s president.\n",
      "Except for one thing: The communist part and the nuclear-war part were concocted.\n",
      "That was all part of the plan.\n",
      "That was the ingenious way that the CIA was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as Oswald was murdered.\n",
      "In the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission.\n",
      "Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.\n",
      "How did Warren resolve this troubling issue?\n",
      "He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.\n",
      "They said no.\n",
      "That was the end of the matter.\n",
      "The issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people.\n",
      "He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed.\n",
      "He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.\n",
      "Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.\n",
      "This troubling issue arose again yesterday, November 2, in the Washington Post in an article entitled “Tantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved – 23 Years Ago.” In the article, author Ian Shapira points out that among the long-secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President’s Commission on CIA Activities, which stated as follows:\n",
      "BELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy.\n",
      "During the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct?\n",
      "HELMS: I believe so.\n",
      "BELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.… The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\n",
      "That’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.\n",
      "Shapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.\n",
      "(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.\n",
      "The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)\n",
      "Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:\n",
      "HELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n",
      "As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.\n",
      "I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.\n",
      "He was certainly not an agent of the CIA.\n",
      "He was certainly never used by the CIA.\n",
      "Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.\n",
      "I believe he was asked to testify.\n",
      "It was a hot item anyway at the time.\n",
      "And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.\n",
      "Shapira ends his article by suggesting that \u001b[0m\u001b[31mcommentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBut Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of.\n",
      "That’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.\n",
      "What is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,” left out of his article?\n",
      "Perjury.\n",
      "He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.\n",
      "A liar.\n",
      "A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.\n",
      "Shapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.\n",
      "Interesting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation’s constitution and violently remove their nation’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office.\n",
      "The reason?\n",

      "Thus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have?\n",
      "It has no value at all.\n",
      "And Shapira, who “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article.\n",
      "The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence.\n",
      "How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?\n",
      "If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?\n",
      "Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?\n",
      "Don’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!\n",
      "After Oswald supposedly tried to “defect” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife?\n",
      "Why wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?\n",

      "At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\n",
      "This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\n",
      "Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.\n",
      "But he also went a step further.\n",
      "He said that he was being framed for the crime.\n",

      "He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.\n",
      "They said no.\n",
      "That was the end of the matter.\n",
      "The issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people.\n",
      "He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed.\n",
      "He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.\n",
      "Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.\n",
      "This troubling issue arose again yesterday, November 2, in the Washington Post in an article entitled “Tantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved – 23 Years Ago.” In the article, author Ian Shapira points out that among the long-secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President’s Commission on CIA Activities, which stated as follows:\n",
      "BELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy.\n",
      "During the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct?\n",
      "HELMS: I believe so.\n",
      "BELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.… The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\n",
      "That’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.\n",
      "Shapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.\n",
      "(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.\n",
      "The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)\n",
      "Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:\n",
      "HELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n",
      "As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.\n",
      "I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.\n",
      "He was certainly not an agent of the CIA.\n",
      "He was certainly never used by the CIA.\n",
      "Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.\n",
      "I believe he was asked to testify.\n",
      "It was a hot item anyway at the time.\n",
      "And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.\n",
      "Shapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.\n",
      "But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of.\n",
      "That’s because \u001b[0m\u001b[31mhe failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",
      "What is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,” left out of his article?\n",
      "Perjury.\n",
      "He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.\n",
      "A liar.\n",
      "A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.\n",
      "Shapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.\n",
      "Interesting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation’s constitution and violently remove their nation’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office.\n",
      "The reason?\n",

      "Thus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have?\n",
      "It has no value at all.\n",
      "And Shapira, who “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article.\n",
      "The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence.\n",
      "How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?\n",
      "If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?\n",
      "Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?\n",
      "Don’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!\n",
      "After Oswald supposedly tried to “defect” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife?\n",
      "Why wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?\n",
      "Why wouldn’t they harass, abuse, humiliate, persecute, or prosecute him, like they did to Martin Luther King, Dalton Trumbo, John Walker Lindh, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors?\n",

      "The CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.\n",
      "The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.\n",
      "At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\n",
      "This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\n",
      "Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.\n",
      "But he also went a step further.\n",
      "He said that he was being framed for the crime.\n",
      "The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?\n",
      "Wouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?\n",
      "That’s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.\n",
      "If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.\n",
      "Who would those confederates be?\n",
      "There could be only one answer: communists.\n",
      "Soviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.\n",
      "How would we know this?\n",
      "That’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.\n",
      "Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\n",
      "Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.\n",
      "Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year.\n",
      "So, President Kennedy has been assassinated.\n",
      "Oswald is immediately arrested.\n",
      "He has confederates firing from the front, who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists, especially since Oswald has supposedly just recently visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City.\n",
      "What does all that mean?\n",
      "An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.\n",
      "That means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the United States is going to sit idly by when the Reds have just assassinated America’s president.\n",
      "Except for one thing: The communist part and the nuclear-war part were concocted.\n",
      "That was all part of the plan.\n",
      "That was the ingenious way that the CIA was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as Oswald was murdered.\n",
      "In the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission.\n",
      "Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.\n",
      "How did Warren resolve this troubling issue?\n",
      "He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.\n",
      "They said no.\n",
      "That was the end of the matter.\n",
      "The issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people.\n",
      "He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed.\n",
      "He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.\n",
      "Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.\n",
      "This troubling issue arose again yesterday, November 2, in the Washington Post in an article entitled “Tantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved – 23 Years Ago.” In the article, author Ian Shapira points out that among the long-secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President’s Commission on CIA Activities, which stated as follows:\n",
      "BELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy.\n",
      "During the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct?\n",
      "HELMS: I believe so.\n",
      "BELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.… The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\n",
      "That’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.\n",
      "Shapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.\n",
      "(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.\n",
      "The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)\n",
      "Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:\n",
      "HELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n",
      "As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.\n",
      "I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.\n",
      "He was certainly not an agent of the CIA.\n",
      "He was certainly never used by the CIA.\n",
      "Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.\n",
      "I believe he was asked to testify.\n",
      "It was a hot item anyway at the time.\n",
      "And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.\n",
      "Shapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.\n",
      "But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of.\n",
      "That’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.\n",
      "What is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,” left out of his article?\n",
      "Perjury.\n",
      "He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.\n",
      "A liar.\n",
      "A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mShapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath\u001b[0m\u001b[32m about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.\n",
      "Interesting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation’s constitution and violently remove their nation’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office.\n",

      "Thus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have?\n",
      "It has no value at all.\n",
      "And Shapira, who “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article.\n",
      "The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence.\n",
      "How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?\n",
      "If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?\n",
      "Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?\n",
      "Don’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!\n",
      "After Oswald supposedly tried to “defect” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife?\n",
      "Why wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?\n",
      "Why wouldn’t they harass, abuse, humiliate, persecute, or prosecute him, like they did to Martin Luther King, Dalton Trumbo, John Walker Lindh, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors?\n",
      "How is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him?\n",
      "How is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the U.S. Marine Corps by openly proselytizing for communism in New Orleans is able to saunter across the Cold War stage of history, not long after the McCarthy hearings, without nary a care in the world?\n",
      "The answer: Helms lied.\n",
      "There is no reasonable doubt that Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent, one who was ordered to travel to Mexico City to set the framework for his frame-up.\n",
      "But things obviously went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City, which is why the CIA had to shut down that part of the post-assassination investigation.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, the CIA’s Mexico City operations regarding Oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that Trump and the CIA have chosen to continue keeping secret from the American people, on grounds of “national security” of course.\n",
      "Thus, when Oswald was claiming that he was being framed, there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about: the CIA, the agency whose officials, as former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley has documented, were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination, no doubt to ensure that Oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him.\n",
      "We can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good.\n",
      "The operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.\n",
      "But no plan is perfect.\n",
      "Things are inevitably going to go wrong.\n",
      "The pieces aren’t going to fit together perfectly.\n",
      "The Mexico City operation is a good example of that.\n",
      "That’s why the CIA has to continue keeping those records secret.\n",
      "But here’s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository.\n",
      "Ask yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?\n",
      "What good would that do?\n",
      "Wouldn’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area?\n",
      "Wouldn’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?\n",
      "Then why the hidden rifle?\n",
      "Because it’s consistent with a frame-up.\n",
      "The framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.\n",
      "would see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.\n",
      "No matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation.\n",
      "That’s where ingenuity and cunning come into play.\n",
      "They had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.\n",
      "That’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear.\n",
      "The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.\n",
      "It was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history.\n",
      "They get the body out of Parkland by force, in violation of Texas law, and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland, which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy.\n",
      "(See my book The Kennedy Autopsy.)\n",
      "Lyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war.\n",
      "As soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI.\n",
      "At the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately.\n",
      "Lyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III.\n",
      "Johnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA’s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.\n",
      "Then keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy.\n",
      "And employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public.\n",
      "And smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a “communist sympathizer” or a “conspiracy theorist.”\n",
      "The CIA’s cunning cover-up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly.\n",
      "Thanks to President Trump and the CIA’s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA’s decades-long secret records secret from the American people, the CIA’s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today.\n",

      "\n",
      "Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.\n",
      "The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.\n",
      "Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.\n",
      "“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.\n",
      "We are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes.\n",
      "“Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”\n",
      "After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.\n",
      "“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”\n",
      "Interestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place.\n",
      "The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.\n",
      "Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people.\n",

      "\n",
      "Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.\n",
      "The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.\n",
      "Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.\n",
      "“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.\n",
      "We are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes.\n",
      "“Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”\n",
      "After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.\n",
      "“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”\n",
      "Interestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place.\n",
      "The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.\n",
      "Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people.\n",

      "The former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop’s conference, Fr.\n",
      "Weinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.\n",
      "None other than Francis appointed Fr.\n",
      "Weinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church.\n",
      "One of the world’s most renowned theologians, Fr.\n",
      "Weinandy is a “man of the Council” and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream.\n",
      "Yet Fr.\n",
      "Weinandy’s letter, sent to Francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him—along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity—is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the Church.\n",
      "The key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology—precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate….\n",
      "This fosters within the faithful a growing unease ….\n",
      "In \"Amoris Laetitia,\" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching….\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mTo teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",
      "The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it.\n",
      "[Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia\" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism.\n",
      "This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry….\n",
      "Such behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by “ad hominem” arguments.\n",
      "[T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine.\n",
      "Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life.\n",
      "Your critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology.\n",
      "But it is precisely Christian doctrine… that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel.\n",
      "Those who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!]\n",
      "separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth… What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death.\n",
      "[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them.\n",
      "What scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice….\n",
      "As a result, many of the faithful, who embody the \"sensus fidelium,\" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd.\n",
      "[T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity.\n",
      "But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite….\n",
      "You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church.\n",
      "You have frequently encouraged… all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think.\n",
      "But… what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it… Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse.\n",
      "I have often asked myself: \"Why has Jesus let all of this happen?\"\n",
      "The only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church, even among too many of her bishops.\n",
      "Ironically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness….\n",
      "Father Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven.\n",
      "As he recounts here, after repeatedly “beseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,” he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: “Keep up the good writing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At lunch the next day, the sign was given.\n",
      "An old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy’s books, said: “Keep up the good writing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Writes Fr.\n",
      "Weinandy: “I could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes.\n",
      "But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something.\n",
      "I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used.\n",

      "“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.\n",
      "“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.\n",
      "I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\n",
      "Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.\n",
      "“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n",
      "“There’s no other way you can coin it.\n",
      "Justice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”\n",
      "Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.\n",
      "The verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”\n",
      "Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "Politics trumps evidence in California once again.” For Jeff Sessions San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” According to the Attorney General’s statement, the Justice Department “will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.”\n",
      "For his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!\n",
      "No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”\n",
      "Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.\n",
      "In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.\n",
      "San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.\n",
      "On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.\n",
      "The Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.\n",
      "During the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.\n",
      "As Gonzalez argued,\u001b[0m\u001b[31m “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",
      "That sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.\n",
      "The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.\n",
      "Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\n",
      "San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.\n",
      "Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.\n",
      "He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.\n",
      "Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.\n",
      "When that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\n",
      "In San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”\n",

      "“We elected you to make reforms, not to smash everything!” Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri, a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013, reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican.\n",

      "\"When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself.\n",
      "The true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable.\"\n",
      "Francis, writes Royal, “has little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church….\n",
      "When the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?” What then indeed?\n",
      "The Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord’s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God’s words: “And lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],” which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a “not a good translation.” Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered mélange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.\n",
      "But now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy.\n",
      "The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example.\n",
      "But never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions.\n",
      "By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the “authentic Magisterium” includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will.\n",
      "The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis’s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be “an apostolic letter.”\n",
      "The normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.\n",
      "We are now expected to believe that the “authentic Magisterium”—meaning simply and only AL—teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:\n",
      "When the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence….\n",
      "\n",
      "In other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable.\n",
      "Nonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment….\n",
      "[I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf.\n",
      "301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf.\n",
      "notes 336 and 351).\n",
      "As Francis would have it, then, the “authentic Magisterium” has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:\n",
      "The admission of public adulterers in “second marriages” to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called “ intrinsically impossible ” given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances—that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament—a moral norm binding “ without exception ” because it is rooted in divine law—is suddenly demoted to a mere “proposal” that may not be “feasible” or “viable” in “the concrete circumstances of the couple.”\n",
      "A valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in “more complex circumstances… when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,” the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.\n",
      "The meaningless slogan “journey of discernment” cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church’s sacramental life.\n",
      "No less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a “new union,” could be “damaged” if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion—evidently because the “new union” would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!\n",

      "As recently as seventeen years ago, during the reign of John Paul II, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915, which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those “who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin.” That prohibition, declared the Pontifical Council, applies to the divorced and “remarried” not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification, but rather “is derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws; [and] the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church.”\n",
      "Francis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church.\n",
      "The attempt is void, of course, and the appellation “authentic Magisterium” is fraudulent.\n",
      "But the consequences of this Pope’s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance \u001b[0m\u001b[31mhalf-baked theological notions,\u001b[0m\u001b[32m such as “discernment” (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.\n",
      "Over the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to “clarify” his intention respecting AL.\n",
      "That clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law.\n",
      "Even if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God—an immoral law is no law at all—Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat, daring invoke the “authentic Magisterium” to cloak his absurd novelties.\n",
      "No Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.\n",
      "So now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?\n",
      "With one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to—at best—hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to “clarify” his already perfectly clear intentions.\n",
      "At this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian “clarification” can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.\n",
      "Continued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge.\n",
      "Their failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.\n",
      "The time for “prudence” is long past.\n",
      "Prudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.\n",
      "The time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable.\n",
      "The members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber, when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage:\n",
      "Where in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?\n",
      "Where are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries, before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage?\n",
      "What we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.\n",
      "Will none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as “a new Athanasius, a new Basil”?\n",
      "Even the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the “confusion” Francis has caused by not “clarifying” precisely what he has just clarified.\n",
      "They avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.\n",
      "That error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self-evident cause—a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition—they seem incapable of identifying.\n",
      "Concerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.\n",
      "But in the midst of that “final battle” over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima, within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage, family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now, for the first time in Church history, being led by a Roman Pontiff.\n",
      "This undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs—first and foremost in the Church—the duty to act.\n",
      "True love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal.\n",
      "2:11).\n",
      "May Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.\n",
      "Our hopes and prayers are with them as the foremost instruments of divine providence in the ecclesia Dei adflicta.\n",
      "Our Lady of Fatima, intercede for us!\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[32mWhat appears to be muzzle flashes emitting from multiple aircraft can be seen on numerous videos captured on the night of the massacre.\n",
      "LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — Newly released footage of the October 1 massacre posted on YouTube by the NICK VEGAS channel appears to confirm what Intellihub’s founder and editor-in-chief Shepard Ambellas pointed out in late October when he presented evidence of the strategic air assault on The Alex Jones Show in great detail.\n",
      "The video shows what appears to be muzzle flashes emanating from the airspace between the Delano Hotel and Mandalay Bay, an airspace that should be free of obstruction altogether.\n",
      "A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas in mid-November which revealed that no aircraft should be occupying that airspace between the hours of 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on the night of the shooting (i.e.\n",
      "no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time.)\n",
      "Not to mention the fact that helicopters are not allowed to hover in the City of Las Vegas without a permit nor are they allowed to lurk behind buildings lower than their roof lines.\n",
      "The first of a series of muzzles flashes can be seen coming from several different elevations, possibly from as many as 3 aircraft (helicopters).\n",
      "The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video.\n",
      "Note: To see the flashes you must view the video on ‘1080p’ and set it to ‘full screen’ and look between the two hotels (adjust the video speed to 25%.)\n",
      "The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios “First Shots” video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2, just one day after the shooting.\n",

      "Haley’s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.\n",
      "“If we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,” Haley warned.\n",
      "“There is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,” she said.\n",
      "“The evidence is undeniable.\n",
      "The weapons might as well have had ‘Made in Iran’ stickers all over it.”\n",
      "Buy Gold at Discounted Prices\n",
      "However, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.\n",
      "As Common Dream’s Reza Marashi explained:\n",
      "“Haley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.\n",
      "Of course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.\n",
      "Instead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have ‘no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.’ Asked about Haley’s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden’s ambassador to the UN said, ‘The info I have is less clear.’ Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley’s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles’ origin.\n",
      "Perhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.\n",
      "Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?\n",
      "The world may never know.”\n",
      "Regardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.\n",
      "Ritter writes:\n",
      "“The missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\n",
      "The modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\n",
      "The UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]\n",
      "So where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\n",
      "According to Ritter:\n",
      "“Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\n",
      "The transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\n",
      "This is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\n",
      "The difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\n",
      "The increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\n",
      "The Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.”\n",
      "﻿\n",
      "Those who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\n",
      "In January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n",
      "“The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]\n",
      "Even if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley’s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn’t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington’s schizophrenic approach to the region.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[32mThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\n",
      "According to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\n",
      "Ritter explains further:\n",
      "“If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\n",
      "The fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\n",
      "If the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\n",
      "No amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\n",
      "This is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.” [emphasis added]\n",

      "As Pope Francis continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church’s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline—he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)—he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment.\n",
      "Determined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium® on his outrageous opinion that in “complex circumstances” wherein it is not “feasible” to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined “process of discernment.” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “discern” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.\n",
      "Do they think we are fools?\n",
      "Then there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller.\n",
      "In a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione’s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church’s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, Müller proposed this preposterous “solution” to a “problem” that does not exist:\n",
      "It is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof.\n",
      "In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.\n",
      "The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense.\n",
      "No Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when—indeed because—he lacks canonical proof of invalidity.\n",
      "Moreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported “second marriage” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery.\n",
      "Cardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church’s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard:\n",
      "Such cases do not exist.\n",
      "No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.\n",
      "Marriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church.\n",
      "If a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of \u001b[0m\u001b[31mnullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\n",
      "The only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “as brother and sister”, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person.\n",
      "Even then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.\n",
      "Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools?\n",
      "Some of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”\n",
      "Apparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of “mercy”: the justification of contraception in “complex cases” to which “discernment” must be applied.\n",
      "Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it.\n",
      "In a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a “moral theologian” of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that “an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.”\n",
      "That is, Francis’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!\n",
      "Chiodi’s sole “authority” for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church.\n",
      "AL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium® products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of “pastoral integration” of homosexual unions.\n",
      "Evidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church.\n",
      "(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which “defends the Faith” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church.\n",
      "Silence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.)\n",
      "But we are not fools.\n",
      "And God will not be mocked.\n",
      "Francis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing.\n",

      "A new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far.\n",
      "“Most Holy Father,” it begins, “‬Many of us ‬have tried to contact you, ‬on many occasions ‬and for several years, ‬and we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.”\n",
      "The letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “a good religion in itself” as the pope “seems to teach”?\n",
      "It’s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church.\n",
      "The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:\n",
      "You do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet).\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[31mIf Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic\u001b[0m\u001b[32m?\n",

      "What union is there between light and darkness?\n",
      "What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?” (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life.\n",
      "Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?\n",
      "The letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:\n",
      "In fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything.\n",
      "As a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: “Between us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!” (Qur’an 60.4) For the Qur’an, Christians “are only impurity” (Quran 9.28),” “the worst of Creation” (Qur’an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur’an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30).\n",
      "We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5).\n",
      "Where the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the “infidels” in exchange for his paradise: “They fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.” (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you “dialogue” means the voice of peace, for Islam it’s only another way to make war.\n",
      "Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous.\n",

      "The authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle “against the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world” because “they share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).” They contest the idea that speaking in an “Islamophilic tone” will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that “apart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).”\n",
      "The letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who “do not welcome any refugee” while Pope Francis preaches\n",
      "the welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: “If anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him.\n",

      "The pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam … Thus ignorant souls are misled…\n",
      "Taking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope’s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians\n",
      "not preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No.\n",

      "If Erdogan is serious, a clash with the U.S. is coming, as our Kurdish allies occupy most of Syria's border with Turkey.\n",
      "Moreover, the U.S. has announced plans to create a 30,000-man Border Security Force of Kurds and Arabs to keep ISIS out of Syria.\n",

      "And the U.S. military will stand behind the BSF.\n",
